# âœ… Learning Roadmap: Becoming a Context Engineer in AI/NLP

---

## ðŸ§© Stage 1: Foundations of AI & NLP

- [ ] Understand tokenization, embeddings, and attention  
- [ ] Learn about Transformer architecture  
- [ ] Study how LLMs are trained and infer responses  
- [ ] Explore basic prompting techniques  

---

## ðŸ§  Stage 2: Prompt & Context Engineering

- [ ] Practice zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting  
- [ ] Use role-based and instruction-based prompting  
- [ ] Learn context window management  
- [ ] Understand Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  
- [ ] Evaluate and iterate on prompt performance  

---

## ðŸ§° Stage 3: Building Context-Aware Systems

- [ ] Use LangChain or LlamaIndex for context pipelines  
- [ ] Work with vector databases (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone)  
- [ ] Implement tool use and function calling  
- [ ] Manage memory and session state  
- [ ] Explore multi-agent systems  

---

## ðŸš€ Stage 4: Advanced Context Engineering & UX

- [ ] Design human-AI interaction and UX flows  
- [ ] Study safety, alignment, and ethical prompting  
- [ ] Use evaluation frameworks (e.g., human feedback)  
- [ ] Compare fine-tuning vs. prompt tuning
